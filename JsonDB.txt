A JSON document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON documents, rather than 
normalizing data across multiple tables, each with a unique and fixed structure, as in a relational database.

JsonDB: a Opensource, Java-based, Database

									Why Jsondb

You have a Java based program (or even Android App) and you:

Need a light weight database of some kind to store a small amount (a few 1000 rows) of data,
Need a pure java, easy to use, thread safe database,
Need some ORM support,
Need a good query interface,
Okay with Mongodb like per API level atomicity (okay with eventualy data consistency),
Want to be able to easily add, edit, update, delete the db data files, even when Jsondb is running,
Want to be able to move the db files seamlessly, download updated files over network while db is running,
Want to be able to safegaurd sensitive data (passwords etc) in the db data files, with some high strength encryption,
